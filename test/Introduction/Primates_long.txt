There are 4 partitions (noncoding, 1stpos, 2ndpos and 3rdpos ) with 205, 231, 231 and 231 sites respectively.
All partitions individually have a gamma site model and HKY substitution model with kappa log-normally distributed (mean-log= 1.0 and stdev-log= 1.25 ) and empirical frequencies with gamma rate heterogeneity using 4 categories (shape exponentially distributed (mean= 1.0 ) ) .

All partitions share a strict clock with clock rate prior uniformly distributed (lower= 0.0 and upper= Infinity ) .

There is a single tree with Calibrated Yule model with birth rate (tree) gamma distributed (alpha=0.001 and beta=1000.0).

Relative substitution rates among all partitions are estimated.

Other information:
 MRCA prior human-chimp (2 taxa) is monophyletic and normally distributed (mean=6.0 and sigma=0.5).
