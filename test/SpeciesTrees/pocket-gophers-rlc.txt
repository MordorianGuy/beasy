This is a multi-species coalescent (StarBeast2) analysis with population model passthrough model with child model is dummy model with popModelAIM.Species and population shape 3.0.
There are 7 partitions (26, 29, 47, 53, 59, 64 and 72 ) with 614, 601, 819, 621, 553, 471 and 706 sites respectively.
All partitions individually have a gamma site model and HKY substitution model with kappa log-normally distributed (mean-log= 1.0 and stdev-log= 1.25 ) and estimated frequencies .

All partitions share a species tree clock model with clock rate log-normally distributed (mean-log= 1.0 and stdev-log= 0.6 ) and random local rates with indicators .

Tree prior: Yule model with birth rate 180.0.
