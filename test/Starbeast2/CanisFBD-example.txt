This analysis is for BEAST 2[1].
This is a multi-species coalescent (StarBeast2) analysis with population model dummy model with.
There are 20 partitions (APOBS1, APOBS2, BDNF, BRCA1S1, BRCA1S2, CHST12, CMKOR1, Ch14, Ch21, Ch24, FGFR3, GHRex09, RAG1, TMEM20, VANGL2, VWF, morphology_canis2, morphology_canis3, morphology_canis4 and morphology_canis5) with 702, 633, 489, 705, 741, 705, 735, 921, 601, 730, 503, 736, 741, 615, 546, 732, 29, 16, 11 and 8 sites respectively.
Partitions APOBS1, APOBS2, BDNF, BRCA1S1, BRCA1S2, CHST12, CMKOR1, Ch14, Ch21, Ch24, FGFR3, GHRex09, RAG1, TMEM20, VANGL2 and VWF individually have a gamma site model and HKY substitution model [2] with kappa log-normally distributed (mean-log= 1.0 and stdev-log= 1.25) and empirical frequencies 
Partitions morphology_canis2, morphology_canis3, morphology_canis4 and morphology_canis5 individually have a gamma site model and.

Partitions APOBS1, APOBS2, BDNF, BRCA1S1, BRCA1S2, CHST12, CMKOR1, Ch14, Ch21, Ch24, FGFR3, GHRex09, RAG1, TMEM20, VANGL2 and VWF share a strict clock with clock rate log-normally distributed (mean-log= 0.001 and stdev-log= 1.0) 
Partitions morphology_canis2, morphology_canis3, morphology_canis4 and morphology_canis5 share a strict clock with clock rate 1/X distributed.

Tree prior: Tree Tree.t:Species has dated tips (in ages not dates). using a fossilised birth death model, with diversification rate prior uniformly distributed (lower=0.0 and upper=Infinity), turnover rate prior uniformly distributed (lower=0.0 and upper=1.0), sampling proportion prior uniformly distributed (lower=0.0 and upper=1.0) and removal probability 0.0. Condition on rho sampling is true, rho 1.0, and origina prior uniformly distributed (lower=0.0 and upper=Infinity).
Relative substitution rates among partitions APOBS1, APOBS2, BDNF, BRCA1S1, BRCA1S2, CHST12, CMKOR1, Ch14, Ch21, Ch24, FGFR3, GHRex09, RAG1, TMEM20, VANGL2 and VWF are estimated.
