There is one alignment with 63 taxa, and 411 characters.
The partition has a gamma site model and GTR substitution model with rateAC gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 10.0), rateAG gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 20.0), rateAT gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 10.0), rateCG gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 10.0), rateCT 1.0 rateGT gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 10.0) and estimated frequencies with gamma rate heterogeneity using 4 categories and shape exponentially distributed (mean= 1.0).

The partition has a strict clock with clock rate 7.9E-4.

There is a single tree with using Bayesian skyline tree prior with population size markov chain distribution with parameter is (hcv).
