There is one alignment with 14 taxa, and 1000 characters.
The partition has a gamma site model and GTR substitution model with rateAC gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 10.0), rateAG gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 20.0), rateAT gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 10.0), rateCG gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 10.0), rateCT 1.0 rateGT gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 10.0) and estimated frequencies with gamma rate heterogeneity using 4 categories and shape exponentially distributed (mean= 1.0).

The partition has a strict clock with clock rate prior uniformly distributed (lower= 0.0 and upper= Infinity).

There is a single tree with Yule model with birth rate (cp3) prior uniformly distributed (lower=0.0 and upper=Infinity).

Other information:
MRCA prior alltaxa (14 taxa) being normally distributed (mean= 40.0 and sigma= 2.0).
