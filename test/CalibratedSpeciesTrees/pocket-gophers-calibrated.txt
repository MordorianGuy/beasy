This analysis is for BEAST 2[1].
This is a multi-species coalescent (StarBeast2) analysis with population model dummy model with.
There are 7 partitions (26, 29, 47, 53, 59, 64 and 72) with 614, 601, 819, 621, 553, 471 and 706 sites respectively.
All partitions individually have a gamma site model and HKY substitution model [2] with kappa log-normally distributed (mean-log= 1.0 and stdev-log= 1.25) and estimated frequencies.

All partitions individually have a strict clock with clock rate 1/X distributed.

Tree prior: Calibrated Yule model with birth rate 1.0.

Other information:
geneTree.t:26 has ploidy 2.0.
geneTree.t:29 has ploidy 2.0.
geneTree.t:47 has ploidy 2.0.
geneTree.t:53 has ploidy 2.0.
geneTree.t:59 has ploidy 2.0.
geneTree.t:64 has ploidy 2.0.
geneTree.t:72 has ploidy 2.0.
MRCA prior root (8 taxa) is monophyletic and exponentially distributed (mean= 0.15).
