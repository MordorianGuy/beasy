This analysis is for BEAST 2[1].
There are 2 partitions (bears_cytb_fossils and bears_irbp_fossils) with 1000 and 1281 sites respectively.
Partitions bears_cytb_fossils has a gamma site model and GTR substitution model with rateAC gamma distributed (alpha= 2.0 and beta= 0.25), rateAG gamma distributed (alpha= 2.0 and beta= 0.5), rateAT gamma distributed (alpha= 2.0 and beta= 0.25), rateCG gamma distributed (alpha= 2.0 and beta= 0.25), rateCT 1.0 rateGT gamma distributed (alpha= 2.0 and beta= 0.25) and estimated frequencies 
Partitions bears_irbp_fossils has a gamma site model and HKY substitution model [2] with kappa log-normally distributed (mean-log= 1.0 and stdev-log= 1.25) and estimated frequencies with gamma rate heterogeneity using 4 categories and shape exponentially distributed (mean= 1.0).

Both partitions share an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed clock [3] with clock rate exponentially distributed (mean= 10.0) and standard deviation exponentially distributed (mean= 0.3337).

There is a single tree with dated tips (in ages not dates)  using a fossilised birth death model, with diversification rate exponentially distributed (mean=1.0), turnover rate prior uniformly distributed (lower=0.0 and upper=1.0), sampling proportion 2.0 distributed (alpha=2.0 and beta=2.0) and removal probability 0.0. Condition on rho sampling is true, rho 1.0, and origina log-normally distributed (mean-log=8.5 and stdev-log=1.0).
Relative substitution rates among both partitions are estimated.
