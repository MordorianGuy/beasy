There are 2 partitions (bears_cytb_fossils and bears_irbp_fossils ) with 1000 and 1281 sites respectively.
Partitions bears_cytb_fossils has a gamma site model and GTR substitution model with rateAC gamma distributed (alpha= 2.0 and beta= 0.25 ) , rateAG gamma distributed (alpha= 2.0 and beta= 0.5 ) , rateAT gamma distributed (alpha= 2.0 and beta= 0.25 ) , rateCG gamma distributed (alpha= 2.0 and beta= 0.25 ) , rateCT 1.0 rateGT gamma distributed (alpha= 2.0 and beta= 0.25 ) and estimated frequencies 
Partitions bears_irbp_fossils has a gamma site model and HKY substitution model with kappa log-normally distributed (mean-log= 1.0 and stdev-log= 1.25 ) and estimated frequencies with gamma rate heterogeneity using 4 categories (shape exponentially distributed (mean= 1.0 ) ) .

Both partitions share an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed clock with clock rate exponentially distributed (mean= 10.0 ) and standard deviation exponentially distributed (mean= 0.3337 ) .

There is a single tree with dated tips (in ages not dates)  using a fossilised birth death model, with diversification rate exponentially distributed (mean=1.0), turnover rate prior uniformly distributed (lower=0.0 and upper=1.0), sampling proportion 2.0 distributed (alpha=2.0 and beta=2.0) and removal probability 0.0. Condition on rho sampling is true, rho 1.0, and origina log-normally distributed (mean-log=8.5 and stdev-log=1.0).

Relative substitution rates among both partitions are estimated.
