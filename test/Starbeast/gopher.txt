This analysis is for BEAST 2[1].
This is a multi-species coalescent (*BEAST) analysis with a linear_with_constant_root population function and gamma log-normally distributed (mean-log=-5.0 and stdev-log=1.25).
There are 3 partitions (26, 29 and 47) with 614, 601 and 819 sites respectively.
All partitions individually have a gamma site model and HKY substitution model [2] with kappa log-normally distributed (mean-log= 1.0 and stdev-log= 1.25) and empirical frequencies.

Partitions 26 has a strict clock with clock rate 1.0 
Partitions 29 and 47 individually have a strict clock with clock rate exponentially distributed (mean= 1.0).

Tree prior: Yule model with birth rate (Species) log-normally distributed (mean-log=4.0 and stdev-log=1.25) gene tree for species tree distribution with gene tree for species tree distribution with gene tree for species tree distribution with.
