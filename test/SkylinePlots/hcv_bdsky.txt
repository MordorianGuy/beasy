There is one alignment with 63 taxa, and 411 characters.
The partition has a gamma site model and GTR substitution model with rateAC gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 10.0 ) , rateAG gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 20.0 ) , rateAT gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 10.0 ) , rateCG gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 10.0 ) , rateCT 1.0 rateGT gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 10.0 ) and estimated frequencies with gamma rate heterogeneity using 4 categories (shape exponentially distributed (mean= 1.0 ) ) .

The partition has a strict clock with clock rate 7.9E-4 .

There is a single tree with birth-death skyline model with with origin log-normally distributed (mean-log=5.0 and stdev-log=0.5), reproductive number log-normally distributed (mean-log=0.0 and stdev-log=1.25), rho 9999.0 distributed (alpha=1.0 and beta=9999.0), and sampling proportion 0.0.
