This is a mutli-species coalescent with migration analysis with population sizes log-normally distributed (mean-log=1.0 and stdev-log=0.25), mean population 1/X distributed, rates of migration log-normally distributed (mean-log=2.5 and stdev-log=1.0), migration model all equal rates, and rate is forward is true.
There are 27 partitions (chr3L-2113, chr3L-2320, chr3L-3176, chr3L-3826, chr3L-4022, chr3L-4737, chr3L-6165, chr3L-6344, chr3L-6457, chr3L-6632, chr3L-8026, chr3L-8877, chr3L-8972, chr3L-10066, chr3L-10352, chr3L-11072, chr3L-11178, chr3L-11427, chr3L-13356, chr3L-13525, chr3L-16124, chr3L-16139, chr3L-17478, chr3L-17583, chr3L-18044, chr3L-18089 and chr3L-19336) with 888, 1558, 633, 807, 1227, 979, 992, 779, 563, 865, 968, 834, 932, 891, 794, 647, 954, 898, 1151, 596, 1101, 794, 902, 795, 1071, 743 and 966 sites respectively.
All partitions individually have a gamma site model and HKY substitution model with kappa log-normally distributed (mean-log= 1.0 and stdev-log= 1.25) and empirical frequencies with gamma rate heterogeneity using 4 categories and shape log-normally distributed (mean-log= 1.0 and stdev-log= 2.0).

All partitions share a strict clock with clock rate 1.0.

Tree prior: Yule model with birth rate (Species) prior uniformly distributed (lower=0.0 and upper=10000.0).
Relative substitution rates among all partitions are estimated.
