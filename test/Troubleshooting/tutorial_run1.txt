This analysis is for BEAST 2[1].
There is one alignment with 36 taxa, and 1000 characters.
The partition has a gamma site model and GTR substitution model with rateAC gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 10.0), rateAG gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 20.0), rateAT gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 10.0), rateCG gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 10.0), rateCT 1.0 rateGT gamma distributed (alpha= 0.05 and beta= 10.0) and estimated frequencies.

The partition has a strict clock with clock rate prior uniformly distributed (lower= 0.0 and upper= Infinity).

There is a single tree with dated tips (in dates not ages) using constant coalescent tree prior with population size 1/X distributed.
