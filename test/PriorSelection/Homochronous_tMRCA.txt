This analysis is for BEAST 2[1].
There is one alignment with 29 taxa, and 1735 characters.
The partition has a gamma site model and HKY substitution model [2] with kappa log-normally distributed (mean-log= 1.0 and stdev-log= 1.25) and estimated frequencies with gamma rate heterogeneity using 4 categories and shape exponentially distributed (mean= 1.0).

The partition has a strict clock with clock rate log-normally distributed (mean-log= 0.001 and stdev-log= 1.25).

There is a single tree with dated tips (in dates not ages) birth-death skyline model with with origin gamma distributed (alpha=0.5 and beta=2.0), reproductive number log-normally distributed (mean-log=0.0 and stdev-log=1.0), rho log-normally distributed (mean-log=0.001 and stdev-log=1.25), and sampling proportion 0.0.

Other information:
MRCA prior allseq (29 taxa) is monophyletic and Laplace distributed (mu= 2008.7745 and scale= 0.5).
