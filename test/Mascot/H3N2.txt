There is one alignment with 24 taxa, and 987 characters.
The partition has a gamma site model and HKY substitution model with kappa log-normally distributed (mean-log= 1.0 and stdev-log= 1.25) and empirical frequencies with gamma rate heterogeneity using 4 categories and shape exponentially distributed (mean= 1.0).

The partition has a strict clock with clock rate log-normally distributed (mean-log= 0.005 and stdev-log= 0.25).

There is a single tree with dated tips (in dates not ages) using structured coalescent approximated through MASCOT with constant population using population size exponentially distributed (mean=1.0) and backward migration rates exponentially distributed (mean=1.0).
