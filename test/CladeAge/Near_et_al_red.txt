All partitions share a bModelTest site model with 4 gamma categories using namedExtended substitution models .

All partitions share an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed clock with clock rate prior uniformly distributed (lower= 0.0 and upper= Infinity ) and standard deviation gamma distributed (alpha= 0.5396 and beta= 0.3819 ) .

There is a single tree with birth death model with unscaled, prior uniformly distributed (lower=0.0 and upper=1.0) and .

Relative substitution rates among all partitions are estimated.
