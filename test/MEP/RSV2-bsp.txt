There are 3 partitions (RSV2_1, RSV2_2 and RSV2_3 ) with 209, 210 and 210 sites respectively.
All partitions individually have a gamma site model and HKY substitution model with kappa log-normally distributed (mean-log= 1.0 and stdev-log= 1.25 ) and empirical frequencies .

All partitions share a strict clock with clock rate log-normally distributed (mean-log= -5.0 and stdev-log= 1.25 ) .

There is a single tree with dated tips (in dates not ages) using Bayesian skyline tree prior with population size markov chain distribution with parameter is (tree) .

Relative substitution rates among all partitions are estimated.
