This analysis is for BEAST 2[1].
There are 3 partitions (RSV2_1, RSV2_2 and RSV2_3) with 209, 210 and 210 sites respectively.
All partitions individually have a gamma site model and HKY substitution model [2] with kappa log-normally distributed (mean-log= 1.0 and stdev-log= 1.25) and empirical frequencies.

All partitions share a strict clock with clock rate log-normally distributed (mean-log= -5.0 and stdev-log= 1.25).

There is a single tree with dated tips (in dates not ages) using Bayesian skyline tree prior with population size markov chain distribution with parameter is (tree).
Relative substitution rates among all partitions are estimated.
