{+@1} Initial analysis should be done with the simplest model with fewest parameters possible, and give a sense of whether there is signal in the data, an indication of run times.
After an initial analysis, more complex models (and thus more parameters) can be added to get better fit to the data, till overparameterisation fails to capture more details.
