Sampled ancestors?
	SABirthDeath based prior - must have tip dates - 
		...
	...
Sequence samples all from different species (or languages)?
	Birth/death/sampling based prior - exploratory (first) analysis?
		no tip dates?
			Yule prior
		Birth/Death model
	Interest in extinction rate or exploratory analysis succeeded?
		Birth/Death model
	Interest in rate history?
		Birth/Death skyline based prior:	
Sequence samples all from same species (or only dialects)?
	Coalescent based prior - exploratory (first) analysis?
		Coalescent with constant population
	Interest in demographic reconstruction (or exploratory analysis succeeded)?
		Bayesian skyline based prior: initial analysis?
			number of groups = 5, make sure upper bound on populations is sensible
		Number of groups should not exceed number of internal nodes
Mix of samples from different species and multiple samples from same species?
	2 species, and one is outgroup?
		Outgroup provides calibration?
			Consider MSC (goto 25) or coalescent (goto 15)
		Remove sequences from outgroup: BEAST does not use them, goto start
	Multi species coalescent (*BEAST, StarBeast2, etc.) goto 6
BEAST cannot deal with Schrodinger sequences...
