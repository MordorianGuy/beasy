Tip dates?	{#1}
	Sampled ancestors?
		SABirthDeath based prior
	goto (+@6)
Sequence samples all from different species (or languages)?	{#6}
	Birth/death/sampling based prior - exploratory (first) analysis?	{#7}
		no tip dates?
			Yule prior
		Birth/Death model
	Interest in extinction rate or exploratory analysis succeeded?
		Birth/Death model
	Interest in rate history?
		Birth/Death skyline based prior:	
Sequence samples all from same species (or only dialects)?
	Coalescent based prior - exploratory (first) analysis?	{#15}
		Coalescent with constant population
	Interest in demographic reconstruction (or exploratory analysis succeeded)?
		Bayesian skyline based prior: initial analysis?
			number of groups = 5, make sure upper bound on populations is sensible
		Number of groups should not exceed number of internal nodes
Mix of samples from different species and multiple samples from same species?
	>= 2 species, and one is outgroup?
		Outgroup provides calibration?
			Consider MSC (goto (+@7)) or coalescent (goto (+@15))
		Remove sequences from outgroup: BEAST does not use them, goto (+@1)
	Multi species coalescent (*BEAST, StarBeast2, etc.) goto (+@7)
BEAST cannot deal with Schrodinger sequences...
