Sequence alignment(s)?
	Gene tree == species tree instead of Multi Species Coalescent?
		Has multiple birth/death/sampling rate changes in tree?
			MSBDtemplate
			Standard
	SNP data
		SNAPP
		snapper (fast but accurate approximation of SNAPP)
	Has migration?
		Is species network instead of tree?
			AIM
		DENIM
	Interested in population sizes on branches?
		*Beast
	Is species network instead of tree?
		SpeciesNetwork
#17:	This requires one of the StarBeast2 templates -- First exploratory analysis?
		Run with strict clock (StarBeast2) + rerun with log normal relaxed clock (SpeciesTreeRLC). Both converge?
			Log normal analysis has coefficient of variation > 0.1?
				Perform model selection strict vs relaxed clock (e.g. nested sampling, path sampling)
			Use strict clock
		Use the analysis that converges
	Relaxed clock analysis preferred from exploratory analysis (@17)?
		Run with random local clock (SpeciesTreeRLC) -- ideal choice, if it converges
		Relaxed clock exponential (SpeciesTreeUCED) -- perform model selection against other clock models
	StarBeast2 using strict clocks
Binary cognate alignment
	BinaryCTMC
	BinaryCovarion
	PDCovarion

	SDollo
Demes/Discrete trait
	Is coalescent?
		Migration rates are function of other data?
			Mascot + GLM
		Has less than 4 demes?
			MultiTypeTree
		Has 4 or more demes
