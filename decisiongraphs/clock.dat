First exploratory analysis?
	Strict clock, followed by relaxed clock log normal if strict clock analysis converges
	Model selection strict vs relaxed clock?
Tree can be partitioned in areas with known differences in clock rates exist?
	FLC: Flexible local clock model
Log normal analysis has coefficient of variation > 0.1?
	Random local clock -- ideal choice, if it converges
	Relaxed clock exponential -- model selection against other clock models
