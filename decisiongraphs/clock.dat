Multi Species Coalescent analysis?
	Initial exploratory analysis but not SNAPP, snapper (others?)?	{#1}
		Run with strict clock (StarBeast2/3) + rerun with log normal relaxed clock (SpeciesTreeUCLN). Both converge?	{#2}
			Log normal analysis has coefficient of variation > 0.1? {#3}
				Perform model selection strict vs relaxed clock (e.g. nested sampling, path sampling) {#4}
			Use strict clock {#5}
		Use the analysis that converges {#6}
	Relaxed clock analysis preferred from exploratory analysis (+@2)? {#7}
		Run with random local clock (SpeciesTreeRLC) -- ideal choice, if it converges {#8}
		Relaxed clock exponential (SpeciesTreeUCED) -- perform model selection against other clock models {#9}
	Use strict clock
