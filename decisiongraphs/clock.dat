First exploratory analysis?
	Run with strict clock + rerun with log normal relaxed clock. Both converge?
		Log normal analysis has coefficient of variation > 0.1?
			Perform model selection strict vs relaxed clock (e.g. nested sampling, path sampling)
		Use strict clock
	Use the analysis that converges
Relaxed clock analysis preferred from exploratory analysis?
	Run with random local clock -- ideal choice, if it converges
	Relaxed clock exponential -- perform model selection against other clock models
Use strict clock
